## Included Files
* Sender.class - Interface that represents the sender (subject object).
* Member.class - Interface that represents the member (observer object).
* GroupAdmin.class - A class that implements Sender.
* ConcreteMember.calss - A class that implements Member.
* UndoableStringBuilder.class - A class that represents an UndoanleStringBuilder object (Exercise 0).
* GroupAdminTest - Tests for the GroupAdmin' methods.
* ConcreteMemberTest - Tests for the ConcreteMember' methods.
## About Observer
Observer Pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern.

Observer design pattern is useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.

In observer pattern, the object that watch on the state of another object are called Observer and the object that is being watched is called Subject.

## ConcreteMember.class
This class is representing the observer in this design pattern.

Every ConcreteMember has 2 private variables: 
* myStr - UbdoableStringBuilder Object.
* name - String Object.

#### `Constructor`:
Assigns name and creates the UbdoableStringBuilder "myStr".
#### `update()`:
Method that recieves the change (UbdoableStringBuilder object) and shallow-copy it
to "myStr". It also prints that "name" got the update!
#### `getMyStr()`:
Since MyStr is private, we created a getter method.
#### `toString()`:
Returns name.

## GroupAdmin.class
This class is representing the subject in this design pattern.

GroupAdmin has 2 private variables: 
* statesCollection - UbdoableStringBuilder Object.
* members - ArrayList of Members type.

#### `Constructor`:
Assigns statesCollection and creates the ArrayList "members".
#### `notifyObservers()`:
Method that notify each observer in "members" of the change in
"statesCollection" by using the update() method.
#### `getStatesCollection()`:
Since statesCollection is private, we created a getter method.
#### `register(Member obj)`:
Methods to register observers (add them to "members").
#### `unregister(Member obj)`:
Methods to unregister observers (remove them from "members").
#### `insert(int offset, String obj)`:
Method that inserts "obj" string into "statesCollection"
starting from "offset".
#### `append(String obj)`:
Methods that appends "obj" string to "statesCollection".
#### `delete(int start, int end)`:
Methods to delete from "statesCollection" the substring 
starting at "start" and ending at "end" (not included).
#### `undo()`:
Method to erases the last change done to "statesCollection" and reverts it
to the previous state it was at.
#### `toString()`:
Returns the current "statesCollection" string and "members" list.
